Udacity P3 - Final Project

TROUBLES:
	1. When finding houses, a lot of them look like "<tag k="building" v="yes"/>". So many are excluded. Only assume if "house"
	2. Parsing source was a bit clumsy. ". or space or additional spaces..."
	3. When I try to gather the information of metro stations some of them are not updated on the map data.
	4. Some of the sources are not known.
	5. A lot of documents are without a source.



DATA OVERVIEW:
	What kind of tags are there? Node, Way, and so on.
	NODE:
		How many nodes?
	WAY:
		How many ways?
	SOURCE: <tag k="source" v="Yahoo"/>
		How many sources?
		Most frequently used source?
	USERS:
		How many unique users?
		Top 1 contributing user?
		Users who appears once.
	SOURCE & USERS:
		For each source who is the top 1 contributing user?

ADDITIONAL IDEAS:
	Top user contribution percentage.
	Top source contribution percentage
	Top source contribution percentage (without None)
	
	Connect node information in "way" to "node" and get position data.
		then for each metro find the metro where the most houses are nearby.
