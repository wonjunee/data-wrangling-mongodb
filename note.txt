Udacity P3 - Final Project

TROUBLES:
	1. When finding houses, a lot of them look like "<tag k="building" v="yes"/>". So many are excluded. Only assume if "house"
	2. Parsing source was a bit clumsy. ". or space or additional spaces..."
	

DATA OVERVIEW:
	What kind of tags are there? Node, Way, and so on.
	NODE:
		How many nodes?
	WAY:
		How many ways?
	SOURCE: <tag k="source" v="Yahoo"/>
		How many sources?
		Most frequently used source?
	USERS:
		How many unique users?
		Top 1 contributing user?
		Users who appears once.
	SOURCE & USERS:
		For each source who is the top 1 contributing user?

ADDITIONAL IDEAS:
	Connect node information in "way" to "node" and get position data.
		then for each metro find the metro where the most houses are nearby.
